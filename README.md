# Free-time-App-OS
This is a project I have worked on in my free time to practice C#. I created it last year, before December, but not long after, I left it. Around November this year, I returned to work on this project. This code is meant to represent a console-based OS. It has a login system and two main applications, those being a calculator and Minesweeper.
